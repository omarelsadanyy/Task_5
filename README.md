# Categorize Numbers as Even or Odd

This Dart program categorizes a list of numbers into even or odd using a `for` loop and an `if` condition.

## How It Works
1. A list of numbers is defined.
2. The program iterates through each number using a `for` loop.
3. For each number:
   - If the number is divisible by 2, it is categorized as even.
   - Otherwise, it is categorized as odd.
4. The results are printed to the console.

## Example Output
Given the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the output will be:
```
1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
4 is even
5 is odd
6 is even
7 is odd
8 is even
9 is odd
10 is even
```

## How to Run
1. Install Dart ([guide](https://dart.dev/get-dart)).
2. Save the program in a file, e.g., `categorize_numbers.dart`.
3. Run it in the terminal:
   ```
   dart categorize_numbers.dart
   ```
